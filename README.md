# Puzzle Solvers

The repo contains simple n-puzzle solvers.

The completed ones, and their respective issues and to-do's are given below.

1. A* Search :- Simple implementation of A* with a simple heuristic. Should work very well for small shuffling and small size of board. To run, enter the A* folder and run puzzle.py

2. Simulated Annealing :- A Sudoku solver that uses the simulated annealing algorithm is implemented. 

Usage:`python sudoku.py <file>`, where `<file>` has the Sudoku puzzle in the required format(some example files have been given).

Other implementations soon to arrive...
